# Quarterly Goal Setting Workbook
**Instructions:** This section is a planning workbook. Use it to brainstorm your goals and define an action plan. Once you are done with the planning, then copy your goals and action plan into Quarterly Goal Setting Template.

**Step 1: List all the things you are currently working on.**
- Family, friends, health, work, your 9-5 job or business, hobbies, finances, spirituality, etc. List goals, projects, and tasks under these areas. Add everything you want to do. Ideally, you want to define a few clear & specific goals in each area. For example, you should expand “lose weight” to “lose 15 pounds in the next three months.
  - [Insert your goal/project/task 1]
  - [Insert your goal/project/task 2]

**Wish List**
Instructions: everyone has a bucket list. Make your wishlist below by writing everything you want to do in the next quarter, year or more. 
- [Insert your wish 1]
- [Insert your wish 2]

Instructions: Review the list of your projects (goals and wish list). Give them a ranking based on the following criteria.
- Which one do you feel most passionate about?
- Do you have a strong “why” for making that goal?
- Is it realistic to achieve the goal in 12 weeks?
- What is the positive impact on your life after accomplishing?
- Is it actionable? Can you start working on it now, or must you wait for something else?

Pick the top one or two goals in the selected area and go to the next step. You must pick the right goal as you will put all your energy into that one or two goals.
- I picked the following as my primary focus/projects.
  - [Insert your project/goal 1]
  - [Insert your project/goal 2]

**Step 3: Make your goals/project very specific:**
Instructions: It will be best to make your projects more specific. S.M.A.R.T - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-Bound.
