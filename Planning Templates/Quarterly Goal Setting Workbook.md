# Quarterly Goal Setting Workbook
**Instructions:** This section is a planning workbook. Use it to brainstorm your goals and define an action plan. Once you are done with the planning, then copy your goals and action plan into Quarterly Goal Setting Template.

## Step 1: List all the things you are currently working on.
- Family, friends, health, work, your 9-5 job or business, hobbies, finances, spirituality, etc. List goals, projects, and tasks under these areas. Add everything you want to do. Ideally, you want to define a few clear & specific goals in each area. For example, you should expand “lose weight” to “lose 15 pounds in the next three months.
  - [Insert your goal/project/task 1]
  - [Insert your goal/project/task 2]

**Wish List**
Instructions: everyone has a bucket list. Make your wishlist below by writing everything you want to do in the next quarter, year or more. 
- [Insert your wish 1]
- [Insert your wish 2]

## Step 2: Pick one or two clear goals (projects) to put most of your energy
Instructions: Review the list of your projects (goals and wish list). Give them a ranking based on the following criteria.
- Which one do you feel most passionate about?
- Do you have a strong “why” for making that goal?
- Is it realistic to achieve the goal in 12 weeks?
- What is the positive impact on your life after accomplishing?
- Is it actionable? Can you start working on it now, or must you wait for something else?

Pick the top one or two goals in the selected area and go to the next step. You must pick the right goal as you will put all your energy into that one or two goals.
- I picked the following as my primary focus/projects.
  - [Insert your project/goal 1]
  - [Insert your project/goal 2]

## Step 3: Make your goals/project very specific:
Instructions: It will be best to make your projects more specific. S.M.A.R.T - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-Bound. Break your goals into the specific outcomes you can achieve in the next three months. Most people don’t set clear goals because they don’t spend enough time defining what they want out of those goals. For example, you should expand “lose weight” to “lose 15 pounds in the next three months.” Additional examples of specific goals are listed below.

- Lose 15 pounds by a specific date (an outcome goal)
- Write 12 Medium articles a specific date (action goal)
- Get 2000 Medium followers on a specific date (an outcome goal)
- Clean my garage by throwing away old boxes and unused items a specific date (action goal)
- Save $5,000 for home improvement by a specific date (an outcome goal)
- Pay off $ 5,000 credit card debt by a specific date (an outcome goal)
- Pay off $11500 extra on the mortgage principle by a specific date (an outcome goal)

## Step 4: Build your weekly action plan

“Don’t make resolutions without an action plan. The secret to success is right in your hands.” — J. Allen Shaw.

Instructions: You are doing excellent. Just a few more steps, and you will be on your way to achieving your most significant goals in a quarter. In this next step, you will break selected goals into smaller monthly & weekly goals. Then, translate them into weekly & daily action steps and start making progress.

For example, to lose 15 pounds, you can divide 15 pounds into three months. You will have to lose 5 pounds every month, which is about one pound weekly. Next, list the daily activities you will need to lose 5 pounds. Some of the everyday activities include -

- Drink one gallon of water daily.
- Instead of eating a big meal, eat a small portion 4 to 6 times daily. Add protein and avoid carbs in your food.
- Exercise 5 days a week for 45 minutes each day. Combine cardio, strength and weight exercise.

You see, by breaking your goals into action items, you will get tremendous clarity on what you have to do to get to the finish line. No, you have the precise steps to work on your goals.

## Step 6: Identify your daily actions

Instructions: Goals are achieved through consistent daily actions. In the above steps, you built a solid plan, but a good strategy only works if you take consistent action. There are several strategies to apply when it comes to taking consistent action. The best one is to build a habit by taking daily actions. When you turn your actions into habits, you get consistency.

If we go back to our example of losing 15 pounds, you should fix a time for drinking water. Some people drink a few glasses of water right after they wake up. A few others fill a big gallon bottle every morning and finish it by the time they go to bed. Similarly, fix a time for the exercise. Go deeper and figure out how you will do these daily actions. Following is an example.

- I will buy a 1-gallon water bottle. I will fill it every morning and drink it by the end of the day.
- I will hire a meal planner who will provide a daily meal plan.
- I will only eat out once a week.
- I will make a weekly workout plan on Sunday. Will combine cardio, strength and weight exercise. Exercise days will be Monday - Friday.
- I will log my weight daily in the morning.

Following are my daily actions.

- [Insert your daily action/outcome 3]

Instructions: Congratulations!! You have completed your quarterly planning. Now, copy your goals and action plan into Part 1 (Quarterly Plan page).
