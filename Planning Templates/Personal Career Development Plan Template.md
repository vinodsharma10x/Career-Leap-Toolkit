Create a career development plan to articulate your goals and plan concrete steps to achieve them.

A comprehensive personal career development plan is essential for developers looking to advance their skills and achieve their professional goals. This plan is designed to be a living document, adaptable to the changing dynamics of your career and the tech industry. It's structured to encourage thoughtful planning, regular review, and adjustments as necessary to stay on track toward achieving your professional goals.

# Use the following template to create your personal development plan.

## 1. Reflect on your career
Read past performance reviews, talk with your supervisor about your strengths, skills, and interests and use the following questions to help you get started.

- Where are you in your career? Are you just starting out, experienced, or an expert?
- What have you valued about previous work experiences?
- What are your strengths?
- What are your skills?
- Which skills are transferable to another career?
- What interests you?
- Where do your skills, strengths, and interests intersect?

## 2. Set Smart Goals
SMART goals are specific, measurable, action-oriented, resonating, and timely. Traditionally, SMART goals were realistic rather than resonant, but recent research has shown that goal achievement is not the result of setting realistic goals but rather of setting goals in alignment with one's values and aesthetic desires.

## 3. Develop skills and build knowledge
Training classes can be an important way to develop your skills and knowledge. Consider other approaches, including mentoring, cross-training, coaching, stretch assignments, leading a project team, serving on a committee, becoming involved in a professional association, attending conferences, computer-based training, listservs, books, and academic degree programs.

## 4. Identify important resources
Do you need funds or time to attend a training class, conference, or participate in an academic degree program? Does your employer provide education assistance? Would it help to discuss/review this plan with your supervisor or mentor?
