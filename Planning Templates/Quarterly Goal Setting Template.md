# How to use this template

There are several methods to set your goals. I like the quarterly goal-setting method in which you list everything you want to do and then pick the top 2–3 things to focus on next quarter.

I started using this method in 2022 to set and achieve my personal goals, and it has been a game changer for me.

In this goal-setting method, you go through the following steps,

- List everything you want to do
- Pick the top 2–3 things to focus on
- Clearly define your goals — what outcome you want to achieve and what action you will take.
- Then, write one paragraph for each goal — why you want to achieve to focus on that area. What will happen if you achieve it, and what will happen if you do not? Write both.
- Now divide your outcome and actions into 12 weeks. This will become your roadmap for one quarter.
- Each week, make a plan for next week. Write down specific items you will do and outcomes you will get.
- Also, review what you have accomplished last week. Create a weekly scorecard like the one below:
  - [% complete] goal/action/outcome
  - [% complete] goal/action/outcome


This method has been working great for me. Try it. If you want examples or additional support, let me know.
