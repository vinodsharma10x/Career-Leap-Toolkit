Ensure the background is neutral and not distracting.
Face should take up about 60-70% of the frame.
Smile to appear approachable.
2. Engaging Background Photo
Choose an image related to your profession or interests.
Ensure it’s high resolution and fits the banner space well.
Avoid overly busy images that could detract from your profile photo.
3. Compelling Headline
Clearly state your current position and company or your area of expertise.
Consider including a value proposition or what you help your company/clients achieve.
Use keywords relevant to your industry for better visibility.
4. Impactful Summary
Begin with a hook to grab attention.
Outline your professional journey, highlighting key achievements and skills.
Share your career goals or what you’re passionate about in your industry.
Include a call to action, such as inviting connections or offering help in your areas of expertise.
Use keywords strategically to improve search visibility.
5. Detailed Experience Section
List current and past positions, including volunteer roles relevant to your field.
For each role, provide a brief description of your responsibilities and accomplishments. Use bullet points for readability.
Highlight achievements with quantifiable results when possible (e.g., “Increased sales by 20%”).
6. Education and Certifications
Include all relevant educational qualifications, certifications, and courses.
For recent graduates, you can list significant projects, societies, or activities related to your professional interests.

List any relevant accomplishments, such as publications, patents, awards, or projects.
Follow companies, influencers, and groups in your industry to show your engagement with current trends.

Personalize your LinkedIn profile URL to make it easier to share and more memorable. Ideally, use your name if it’s available.
11. Privacy Settings
Review your privacy settings to control what’s visible to your network and the public.
