# Part 3 - Quarterly Planning Workbook
**Instructions:** This section is a planning workbook. Use it to brainstorm your goals and define an action plan. Once you are done with the planning, then copy your goals and action plan into Part 1 (Quarterly Plan page).

**Step 1: List all the things you are currently working on.**
- Family, friends, health, work, your 9-5 job or business, hobbies, finances, spirituality, etc. List goals, projects, and tasks under these areas. Add everything you want to do. Ideally, you want to define a few clear & specific goals in each area. For example, you should expand ‚Äúlose weight‚Äù to ‚Äúlose 15 pounds in the next three months.

**Step 2: Pick one or two clear goals (projects) to put most of your energy**
Instructions: Review the list of your projects (goals and wish list). Give them a ranking based on the following criteria.
- Which one do you feel most passionate about?
- Do you have a strong ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for making that goal?
- Is it realistic to achieve the goal in 12 weeks?
- What is the positive impact on your life after accomplishing?
- Is it actionable? Can you start working on it now, or must you wait for something else?

Pick the top one or two goals in the selected area and go to the next step. You must pick the right goal as you will put all your energy into that one or two goals.

**Step 3: Make your goals/project very specific:**

Break your goals into the specific outcomes you can achieve in the next three months. Most people don‚Äôt set clear goals because they don‚Äôt spend enough time defining what they want out of those goals. For example, you should expand ‚Äúlose weight‚Äù to ‚Äúlose 15 pounds in the next three months.‚Äù Additional
