# Steps to start

1. Build your team of 2 to 3 developers
    
2. Decide a weekly or daily meeting time
    
3. Select a project and expand it into smaller feature sets and areas of work
    
4. Pick your tools, such as GitHub, JIRA, Figma, Visual Studio, Google Docs, etc.
    
5. Select the technology stack - languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools
    
6. Create JIRA stories & tasks
    
7. Start coding
    

  

# Build your team

Do you have friends who will join your project, or could you make a team of 2-3 people to do this project? Someone who has the same emotions and needs as you. It is optional, so remember to start with only 2-3 people. You don't need too many.

  

Fill in the team member information table below.

  

Let everyone pick their desired role. It is better if everyone understands the project & code end to end, but choosing the primary role is still a good idea. 

  

Distribute the roles further and choose who will be the project manager, GitHub manager, deployment person, etc.

## Decide a weekly or daily meeting time

For example, Wednesday, 7:00 pm – 8:00 pm (CST) / 8:00 pm – 9:00 pm (EST)

  

## Team Agreement

Have some commitment with each team member

  

Why are you doing this project? Why is it important to you?

  

What exactly will you do in this project as a team?

  

How much time you will be able to devote to this project (per day or per week)?

  

How will you do this project?

  

Ideas:

- Check & update JIRA stories daily 
    
- Checking your updates in Github daily 
    
- Share your weekly updates on LinkedIn & Twitter 
    
- Block your calendar to work on this project and stick with it 
    
- #Buildinpublic - Weekly updates, weekly JIRA & GitHub updates
    

  

# Project ideas

Please check out the "Project Idea" document for the project ideas.

## Selected project <<Project Name>>

Break your project into smaller feature sets and areas of work. Then, create application flow for example, each web application has a login flow, homepage, and flow for each feature.

Then, design basic wireframes and mockups for various screens. You can do this on a notepad.

# Pick your tools

Select your tools, such as GitHub, JIRA, Figma, Visual Studio, Google Docs, etc.

  

Setup them and add team members

## GitHub 

- Create a new GitHub repository
    
- Add members
    
- Create code folders
    
- Create dev, test, and prod branches beside the main branch. You can also treat the main branch as your production branch. 
    
- Create a readme file
    
- Ask all team members to set up the GitHub project on their machine. Once done, make a change, commit/push to dev, test, and main branches to see if it works.
    

  

## Figma for brainstorming & mockup

- You can use a free version of [Figma](https://www.figma.com) to create application flow, wireframe, mockup and prototype. 
    
- There are alternative options, such as the Miro and Lucid apps.
    
- Don’t spend too much time exploring all possible templates in Figma. Use sticky notes to expand the project idea into a feature set and a flowchart template to create application flow
    

  

## JIRA

- JIRA is a project management tool that allows you to create project stories (requirements and action items), assign them to various team members and track them on a visual board.
    
- Alternative options include the GitHub project, Trello, Notion, Asana, etc. I recommend managing your project using either JIRA or the GitHub project.
    

  

## Google Docs, Confluence and GitHub repository

- You can use Google Docs, Confluence or GitHub markdown files to store project information, documentation, feature list etc.
    

##   
Team collaboration tool

- Pick an application to send messages and connect with each other. 
    
- Discord and Slack are good options. You can use them to host your group conference call and share screens.
    
- You can also use Twitter or WhatsApp groups.
    

## Deployment

You can use Vercel or Netlify to host your application.

  

# Select your tech stack

Select the technology stack for the project.

  

The tech stack includes programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and other tools.

  

- Language - Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, CSS, HTML 
    
- Frameworks - React, ReactNative, Django
    
- Web Identity Framework (Google Login) 
    
- Database - PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Amazon DynamoDB 
    
- Tools - VS Code, Miro, Draw.io, GitHub, JIRA 
    
- Deployment - Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Azure, or GitHub. Plus a CI/CD Pipeline 
    
- Container - Docker, Teraform
    

  

There are many criteria to consider, such as the best fit for the project and what technology is more popular in your local job market. 

  

Following is an example of the technology stack selected by one of the team

  

Frontend

- Next.js (it comes with React, Tailwind CSS, Typescript)
    

  

Backend 

- Express
    
- NodeJs
    

  

Database

- PostgreSQL
    

  

AI

- ChatGPT API
    

  

Additional Roles

  

- QA
    
- Dev Ops
    
- Project Manager
    
- Business Analyst
    

  
  

# Create JIRA stories & tasks

- You can create Epics, stories, tasks, bugs, and sub-tasks in JIRA. You can also choose Scrum and Kanban as your project types.
    
- I recommend creating a Kanban project and using only stories to keep things simple. 
    
- Start by creating high-level stories, then create smaller stories
    
- You can group similar stories (area of work) under an Epic
    
- Assign stories to team members
    
- When you start working on a story, move it from To Do to In-Progress. When you finish, move it to the Done column.
    

  

# Start coding

- The first step is to create the basic code structure that includes the selected framework and libraries.
    
- Then, have each team member clone the GitHub repository on their machine, run the application locally and make a small change to the dev/test/prod branch to ensure everything works.
